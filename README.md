# kubefed-operator

This repository contains code for an operator for deploying [KubeFed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed). It is planned to replace the [federation-v2-operator repo](https://github.com/openshift/federation-v2-operator).

## Deploying and testing

This work-in-progress section describes how people _developing_ this operator can deploy it.

### Using `operator-sdk up local`

The operator SDK provides a way to run your operator locally outside a cluster. This allows you to easily iterate on changes without having to push an image.

All you need to do is run the following command from the root directory of this project:

```
$ operator-sdk up local --namespace=kubefed-test
```

This will run the operator configured to watch the `kubefed-test` namespace.

After that step, you can create a `KubeFed` custom resource in the `kubefed-test` namespace to drive the installation in that namespace:

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/operator_v1alpha1_kubefed_cr.yaml -n kubefed-test
```
